# JavaDecoratorPattern
An example using Burgers explaining the Decorator Pattern.

In object-oriented programming, the decorator pattern is a design pattern that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, 
dynamically, without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

Decorator pattern allows a user to add new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure. 
This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern acts as a wrapper to existing class.

This pattern creates a decorator class which wraps the original class and provides additional functionality keeping class 
methods signature intact.

The exapmple demonstrates the use of decorator pattern via using a basic burger and adding condiments on top of it.
